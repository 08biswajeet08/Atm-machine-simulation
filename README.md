# Atm-machine-simulation

In this project, we develop a Python program simulating an ATM machine. It features functionalities such as checking balances, withdrawing and depositing funds, transferring money between accounts, and changing PINs. This project aims to replicate the core operations of a real ATM, providing practical experience in software development and system simulation.
